## Frequently asked questions

 - **do i have to download the resource packs?**
   - you don't have to, but the majority of players on the server use it. so if you want the same experience as everyone else and see how the structures and such were designed to look, it's a good idea to download the resource packs.

 - **what resource pack size should i download? (128x128, 256x256, etc...)**
    - that's up to you really, but it might also depend on how powerful your computer is. if you have a toaster i don't recommend getting the resource pack or shaders.
